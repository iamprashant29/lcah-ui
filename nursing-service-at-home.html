            <div class="panel-body">A nurse is a medical professional responsible for medical procedures, safety and recovery of patients from acute and chronic health issues. An in-home nurse is all that and more, in that he or she cares for you in your home, integrating him or herself into your family.</div>

        <div class="panel panel-primary">
            <div class="panel-heading">How can we help?</div>
            <div class="panel-body">Our in-home nurses excel in providing services such as post-surgical care, elder care, chronic care, tracheostomy, urinary catheterisation care, wound care, injections, and IV infusions. Whatâ€™s more, they are always supervised by a senior doctor. Get well sooner by getting 12 / 24-hr care from a LCAH in-home nurse.</div>
